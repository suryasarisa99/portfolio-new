# Website Code Extractor

What started as a simple personal tool became a Chrome extension used by **850+ developers worldwide**. The Website Code Extractor extension solves a common problem: quickly downloading and analyzing website source code for learning, debugging, or inspiration.
It works well with static websites, but its not recommended for dynamic websites that rely on a heavy backend or frameworks like Next.js or React.

## The Genesis

As a developer, I often found myself wanting to examine how certain websites implemented specific features. The browser's "View Source" was limited, and manually saving files was tedious. I needed something that could:

- **Extract complete source code** including all assets
- **Organize files** in a logical folder structure  
- **Download as ZIP** for easy sharing and analysis
- **Work on any website** with a single click

> "Why isn't there a simple way to download a website's complete source code? Let me build it."

## Impact & Results

The extension has become a valuable tool for the developer community:

- **850+ Active Users**
- **5/5 Star Rating**
- **Educational Use**
- **Professional Use**

### User Testimonials

> "this tool works really great for small websites! the zip packaging works and even keeps the website structure intact, which is awesome. the only downside ive noticed is that the picture paths or icons paths arent the same as on the original site, which is understandable, but overall, its really good." - Realest (google user)
