# Earn Money by Reffering Your Friends

**One Novel** is a platform that allows you to earn money by referring your friends to buy books. You can earn a commission for every book sold through your referral link. Even you can earn by uploading your own books. The platform helps readers discover new titles while also supporting authors to showcase their work. It creates a simple and rewarding way to connect readers, writers, and book lovers in one place.
