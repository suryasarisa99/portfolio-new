# Expert Location & Communication – Real-time, Location-Aware Student–Tutor Chat

**Expert Location & Communication** is a modern, real-time chat platform that helps students quickly connect with nearby tutors and teachers. It combines **Socket.IO** for instant updates, **Firebase Storage** for media sharing, and **Gemini API** for smart assistance when a tutor is offline—delivering fast, context-aware support across devices.


> **Why this app?** Traditional academic chats are slow, siloed, or desktop-only. This app prioritizes *proximity*, *presence*, and *performance* so students get timely help that actually fits how they learn today.
