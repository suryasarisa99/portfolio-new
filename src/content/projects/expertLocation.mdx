# Design Philosophy

The design philosophy behind Sola centers on **minimalism with purpose**. Every element serves a function, from the subtle animations that guide user attention to the carefully chosen typography hierarchy.

> "Good design is as little design as possible" - Dieter Rams

The goal was to create a space where content breathes and visitors can focus on what matters most.

## Technical Architecture

Built with a **component-first approach** using React and TypeScript for type safety. The architecture includes:

- **Vite** for fast development builds
- **Tailwind CSS** for consistent styling and design system
- **Framer Motion** for smooth animations and transitions
- **React Router** for client-side routing
- **shadcn/ui** for accessible, customizable components; works well with Tailwind CSS

## Future Enhancements

I've already added so much that im running out of ideas, however heres what i thought of adding:

- **Blog Integration**: Technical writing section
- **Interactive Demos**: Live code examples for projects (possibly here)
- **now** page: inspired by a <a href="https://nownownow.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">now</a> page.
